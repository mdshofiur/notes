### **Troubleshooting Cassandra Using Docker Logs**

**Introduction:**
In this document, we'll explore how to troubleshoot a Cassandra instance running in a Docker container using various log-related commands. Cassandra is a popular distributed NoSQL database, and Docker containers provide a convenient way to deploy and manage it. However, diagnosing issues within a containerized environment requires familiarity with Docker commands and Cassandra's logging mechanisms.

**Prerequisites:** 

- Basic understanding of Docker
- Basic knowledge of Cassandra
- Access to a terminal with Docker installed

**Troubleshooting Steps:** 

**Way-1:-**

- Viewing Docker Logs:

```bash
docker logs cassandra-container
```
**Way-2:-**

```
docker exec -it cassandra-container /bin/bash

find / -name "*.log"

cat /var/log/cassandra/system.log

sudo tail -f /var/log/cassandra/system.log

```

#### Conclusion:
Troubleshooting Cassandra within a Docker container involves accessing logs and log files to identify and resolve issues. By leveraging Docker commands to view logs and accessing the container's filesystem, you can diagnose problems effectively. Understanding Cassandra's logging mechanisms and using tools like ‘cat’ and ‘tail’ enable efficient troubleshooting of database-related issues in a containerized environment.
